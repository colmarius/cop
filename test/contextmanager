ContextManager
==============

The context manager is the coordinator of context objects. An instance is created by specifying explicitly what are the contexts of interest, and also what are the relations between them.

It should:
 * have a dictionary of contexts (context_name => context_object), and
   also contexts should have unique names
 * have a dictionary of relations (context_name => relations_object), and
   also relations should be defined only between known context names
 * have a set of active contexts
 * have a set of contexts to activate
 * have a set of context to deactivate
 * be able to get a context object by name
 * be able to get a context relations object by context name
 * be able to know if a context is active or not
	 should I explicitly say context.activate() or context.deactivate(), or
	 should I trigger context presence when detected
 * be able to trigger a context activation event
 * be able to handle objects with adaptations dynamic runtime composition
   when triggered a context activation event
 * be able to resolve a conflict for one two or more context for an object
   and provide instead a resolved no-conflict adaptation
