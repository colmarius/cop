Context
=======

The context object is used to store adaptations for objects. 

It should:
 * have a name (non-empty string), unique among all context objects
 * have adapted objects
 * have adapted traits
 * be able to set an adaptation (a trait) for any object, but not for the global object
 * be able to get an adaptation (the trait) for an object, if already stored

Attributes
----------

	`name` the context name as a string

Methods
-------

	`setAdaptation(object, trait)` receives to parameters the object and the trait and stores them

	`getAdaptation(object)` receives one parameter, the object, and returns the trait for that object or undefined if there is no such adaptation stored
